# Natural Selection - model description

This document is a high-level description of the model used in PhET's _Natural Selection_ simulation.

## Terminology

* trait - a characteristic or feature that can be passed from one generation to another
* gene - a message for a particular trait, made up of DNA
* alleles - the different variations of a gene
* genotype - the total of all the genetic messages in an organism; the total blueprint for the organism
* phenotype - the way the organism appears and functions because of its genes; what is built from the genotype
* dominant trait - With dominant traits, an individual carries either two dominant alleles or one dominant and one recessive allele. A dominant allele can be expressed even if only one copy of the allele is present.
* recessive trait - A recessive trait will only be expressed if an individual has two recessive alleles.
* selecting agent = any factor, environmental or otherwise, that affects fertility or mortality
* chromosomes - contain genes for certain traits

* A dominant allele hides a recessive allele and determines the organism's appearance.
* When an organism has two copies of the same allele, it is said to be homozygous for that gene. 
* When an organism has two different alleles, we can say it is heterozygous for that gene.

* mutation
* Mendelian Genetics (Gregor Mendel), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance


In the context of this sim:

* A bunny has 3 traits, and 3 corresponding gene types: fur, ears, teeth.
* Each gene type has 2 variations, known as alleles.
* The alleles for fur are 'white fur' and 'brown fur'.
* The alleles for ears are 'tall ears' and 'flat ears'.
* The alleles for teeth are 'short teeth' and 'long teeth'.
* A bunny has 3 pairs of genes - 1 gene of each pair is inherited from each parent.
* A bunny's *genotype* is its complete set of 6 genes (3 pairs).
* A bunny's *phenotype* is how the bunny appears and function due to its genotype.
