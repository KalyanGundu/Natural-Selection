## Terminology

* trait - a characteristic or feature that can be passed from one generation to another
* gene - a message for a particular trait, made up of DNA
* alleles - the different variations of a genetic message
* genotype - the total of all the genetic messages in an organism; the total blueprint for the organism
* phenotype - the way the organism appears and functions because of its genes; what is built from the genotype
* dominant trait - With dominant traits, an individual carries either two dominant genes or one dominant and one recessive gene. A dominant gene can be expressed even if only one copy of the gene is present.
* recessive trait - A recessive trait will only be expressed if an individual has two recessive alleles.

* mutation
