# TODO list for natural-selection

Specific things:

* rename NaturalSelectionSprites to OrganismSprites
* update Proportions graph only if it's visible, or document that it's not a performance issue
* update Pedigree graph only if it's visible, or document that it's not a performance issue
* factor out duplication in WolfCollection.eatBunnies
* delete query parameters that have outlived their usefulness

General things:

* Too many Properties with 'generation' in their name is confusing
* More iteration over genes, less brute-force
* Figure out things I don't understand in Bunny.js, Wolf.js, EnvironmentModelViewTransform.js
