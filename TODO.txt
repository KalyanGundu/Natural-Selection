# TODO list for natural-selection

* Rename wolvesPercentToKill and limitedFoodPercentToKill to indicate that they are ranges, change in model.md
* Factor BunnySpritesMap (and other things?) out of OrganismSprites
* Too many Properties with 'generation' in their name is confusing
* More iteration over genes, less brute-force
* Figure out things I don't understand in Bunny.js, Wolf.js, EnvironmentModelViewTransform.js
* Migrate ZoomControl to common?
