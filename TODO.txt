TODO list for natural-selection

IO
Review instrumentation of Bunny and BunnyNode with IO team
Serialization of Bunny father and mother
How is cyclic serialization handled? A -> B -> C -> A, or A <-> B
What if I need to use BunnyIO for a Bunny that's not managed by BunnyGroup?
Is using PhetioGroup.createCorrespondingGroupMember for view a requirement or convention?\
Symmetry between IO type hierachy and non-IO class hierarchy - goal?

DESIGN
Make graphs wider by making control panels narrower?
Animate contents of Proportions view when switching generations?
Move playback control near generation clock?
