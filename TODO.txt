# TODO list for natural-selection

Specific things:

* rename NaturalSelectionSprites to OrganismSprites

General things:

* Too many Properties with 'generation' in their name is confusing
* More iteration over genes, less brute-force
* Figure out things I don't understand in Bunny.js, Wolf.js, EnvironmentModelViewTransform.js
