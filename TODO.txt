# TODO list for natural-selection

Implementation

* Delete CauseOfDeath
* Too many Properties with 'generation' in their name is confusing
* More iteration over genes, less brute-force
* rename NaturalSelectionSprites to OrganismSprites
* update Proportions graph only if it's visible, or document that it's not a performance issue
* update Pedigree graph only if it's visible, or document that it's not a performance issue
* factor out duplication in WolfCollection.eatBunnies
